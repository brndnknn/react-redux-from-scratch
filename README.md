# react-redux-from-scratch

I learned how to use redux to manage an application's state on freecodecamp.org, which uses sandboxes.

In this repo I will follow the tutorials on redux.js.org to learn more.

I have initialized this repo with the included react-template.sh file

At the end I will update the file to a version that initializes a react-redux app.
